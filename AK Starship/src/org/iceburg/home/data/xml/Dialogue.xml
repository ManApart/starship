<!-- 
type is translated into an int, see the static ints in the MessageCenter Class

This is used because negative responses are 1 higher on the hashmap,
making yes = false just tells the game to raise the type number 1

This is useful because some game messages check whether the response should be positive or negative,
so one static value typeDefaultResponse can be fetched along with the bool the game provides to
give both a positive or negative response depending on the situation.


**************************************************
For types with a yes or no response, the no response is the second id, or odd number

Types:
0= typeDefaultResponse (yes)
1= typeDefaultResponse (no)
2= typeEngineerTileType
4= typeWeaponsTargetable
typeEquipWeapon = 6;
typeSecurityDoorInfo = 8;
typeSecurityDoorSetClose = 10;
typeCanTravel = 12;
typeCanTravelNo = 13;
